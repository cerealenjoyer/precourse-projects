# Pre-apprenticeship project repository

Hi! Here's where I'm keeping the projects that I've been working on over the 12 week pre-course element of FAC22. 

## What to expect

Hopefully each week I'll be able to populate this repository with some of the exciting things that me and my cohort have been working on. I'm writing this in week 1 so the layout/content is liable to change, but watch this space!

### [Javascript Keyboard](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-1/emoPiano/index.html)

Using lessons from the Javascript30 lesson 'Javascript Drum Kit', I made this (extremely) simple piano. Taking inspiration from films like Grand Piano I made a simulation of a 'musical combination lock', a locked box hidden inside a piano that only unlocks on playing a certain melody - in this case the opening riff from a 'My Chemical Romance' song (hence the name 'emoPiano').
Try listening [to the start of Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uncMEJkBc) and trying to replicate the sequence, or if you're impatient, you can cheat.

### [CSS and Javascript Clock](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-1/horrorClock/index.html)

I made a simple clock in JS and CSS, and decided to try and link it thematically to the previous project: inspired by my wasted youth playing point-'n-click mystery games I made a *Silent Hill* inspired puzzle clock - watching it until the second hand hits '0' causes it to click and shift, unlocking another door.

### [Editing CSS Variables with Javascript](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-3/css-variables/index.html)

I was really excited to learn about CSS Variables. DOM Manipulation was my favourite part of learning how to build a website, I love the crunchiness of it and I think it's really cool that you can make your JavaScript interact with your HTML, it suddenly makes a website feel like 'serious business'. Adding CSS into the mix feels like the coup de grace.
Inspired by films like Jacob's Ladder, as well as the found-footage photography artwork of Trevor Henderson, I tried to use CSS Variables to make a photo of an everyday tableau 'shift' into a ruined, uncomfortable environment: You can adjust the sliders on the left to add layers of decay onto the photo, and for subtlety you can blur them out with the sliders on the right, to lessen the effect.

### [Agency Website](https://fac22.github.io/DaSha-Agency/)

This was my first piece of groupwork; I worked with Danilo (he's great tooo by the way, if you don't hire me, hire him!) to make a design agency one-page website. Our planning discussions revealed a mutual interest in dystopian fiction and ruined architecture, so we came up with the idea of a design site from hell: If the gold standard of software engineering was to build products that last the test of time, we wanted our site to visibly crumble and decay the longer you spent on it. As you scroll down the site, the background begins to fall apart, and an ordinary suburban street becomes overgrown with rust and plantlife.
We had an idea that was going to be even more intrusive: A timer would start when you logged into the website and over time CSS elements would become buggy - kerning would become uneven, margins would start to unravel, but sadly this idea was seen as too time-consuming for the timeframe we were given and was abandoned in favour of making sure the website was legible and accessible. (Probably the right call to be honest).

### [Who's that pokemon?](https://cerealenjoyer.github.io/precourse-projects/week-8/real-world-fetch/workshop.html)

You might have seen a fair few of these already, because this was based on a workshop that we went through in lessons: Based on the [Who's that pokemon](https://i.imgur.com/av0BXKO.png) stinger that played in ad-breaks of the cockfighting-fantasy children's show Pokemon, I made an extremely simple API lookup: Type a pokemon name (or number) into the search input, get a Pokemon out. 
My favourite part of this one was learning to use (and make) SVGs. When I started I had no idea that what I thought was an extremely simple goal (to make some text curve out *slightly* would involve opening GIMP, drawing a line for the text to follow, converting it into a path, exporting that path and then instructing the text to follow that (fill-less, borderless) path. Any time I see path text on a website now, I silently thank the frontend developer for their service.
