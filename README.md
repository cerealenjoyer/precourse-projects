# Pre-apprenticeship project repository

Hi! Here's where I'm keeping the projects that I've been working on over the 12 week pre-course element of FAC22. 

## What to expect

Hopefully each week I'll be able to populate this repository with some of the exciting things that me and my cohort have been working on. I'm writing this in week 1 so the layout/content is liable to change, but watch this space!

### [Javascript Keyboard](../week-1/emoPiano/index.html)

Using lessons from the Javascript30 lesson 'Javascript Drum Kit', I made this (extremely) simple piano. Taking inspiration from films like Grand Piano I made a simulation of a 'musical combination lock', a locked box hidden inside a piano that only unlocks on playing a certain melody - in this case the opening riff from a 'My Chemical Romance' song (hence the name 'emoPiano').
Try listening [to the start of Black Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uncMEJkBc) and trying to replicate the sequence, or if you're impatient, you can cheat.
