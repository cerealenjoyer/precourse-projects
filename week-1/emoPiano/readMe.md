## This is my project based on the Javascript30 challenge 'Drum Kit', which I've called the Emo Piano.
Operating the keyboard, you can use this tool to play a riff that will be instantly recognisable to a certain subsection of internet sad people ;(
If you can play the riff perfectly (no hints here, you either know it or you don't), you might find an easter egg!
