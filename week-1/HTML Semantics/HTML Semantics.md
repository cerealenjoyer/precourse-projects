# HTML Semantics
Semantics are super useful both for increasing efficiency when working collaboratively with other coders, and when building websites with accessibility in mind.

Semantics tells the browser what an element is, so rather than using a `<div>` element every time, and relying on CSS classes to differentiate, you can instead make sure that things are correctly labelled as semantic elements like `<button>` `<article>` `<header>` and others

If your CSS fails to load, a clearly laid out page that makes good use of semantic HTML will still make sense to the user.

Screen readers, which are often used by visually-impaired users, make decisions on how to present the content on your website based on semantic elements. Semantic HTML tags ensure that important text is given proper significance, even if a user cannot see (for example) what you have chosen to put in **bold**
